L0272: db 00
L0273: db '     These are my observations concerning the organization k'
 db 'nown as The Fellowship.'
L02C6: db 00
L02C7: db 'Although The Fellowship portends to be a group of optimists '
 db 'with a philosophy called `Triad of Inner Strength', there ar'
 db 'e many fallacies which can be gleaned by careful examination'
 db ' of the group's `values'.'
L0394: db 00
L0395: db 'The first `value' is Strive For Unity. This implies that tha'
 db 't we should all work together in harmony and towards one goa'
 db 'l in life. However, careful examination of this tenet reveal'
 db 's that members of The Fellowship consider themselves an elit'
 db 'e group, and a prejudicial one at that. They tend to believe'
 db ' that if one is not for them, then they are indeed against t'
 db 'hem! And if one is against them, then may fortune be with th'
 db 'at person, for he/she may very well come to a bad end!'
L056F: db 00
L0570: db 'The second `value' is Trust Thy Brother. This implies that e'
 db 'ach member trusts implicitly other Fellowship members, and t'
 db 'hat each will do favors or deeds for another without questio'
 db 'n. On the other hand, this might mean that a member should d'
 db 'o what another says REGARDLESS of the implications of the ac'
 db 't. In other words, `do as I say and do not question it!' see'
 db 'ms to be the underlying subtext of this tenet.'
L0706: db 00
L0707: db 'The third `value' is Worthiness Precedes Reward. If one does'
 db ' good deeds for The Fellowship, then one will be rewarded. T'
 db 'he other side of the coin, of course, is that if one does NO'
 db 'T do good deeds for The Fellowship, then one will get his JU'
 db 'ST reward! In The Fellowship, a `reward' can be either `good'
 db '' or `bad'!'
L083E: db 00
L083F: db 'The Fellowship has been duping the masses of Britannia now f'
 db 'or twenty years. They are becoming stronger and stronger. Af'
 db 'ter careful study, I have come to the conclusion that the gr'
 db 'oup is serving some higher, malevolent entity, referred to b'
 db 'y the organization's inner circle as `The Guardian'. More in'
 db 'formation needs to be obtained about The Guardian, but I am '
 db 'certain that he is very dangerous.'
L09C9: db 00
L09CA: db 'The Fellowship seems to be organized into three distinct gra'
 db 'des of members. Grade One consists of the general masses of '
 db 'naive innocents who have joined, thinking that their patheti'
 db 'c little lives will be helped in some way. Grade Two consist'
 db 's of the various branch leaders who make up the inner circle'
 db ' of Fellowship leaders.'
L0B0D: db 00
L0B0E: db 'There is also a Grade Three -- those Fellowship leaders who '
 db 'are in administrative positions within the group: men such a'
 db 's Batlin, and the mysterious couple Elizabeth and Abraham wh'
 db 'o travel the country distributing The Fellowship's funds. (N'
 db 'ot much is known about these two -- it is said they are twin'
 db 's -- brother and sister.) I believe that the few Grade Three'
 db ' members are in direct communication with The Guardian and b'
 db 'elieve they will be serving as his lieutenants should The Gu'
 db 'ardian ultimately gain power in the land.'
L0D17: db 00
L0D18: db 'Already, The Guardian is promising to be a powerful threat. '
 db 'Magic in Britannia has taken a turn for the worse in the pas'
 db 't few years. I believe that The Guardian has done something '
 db 'to cause this malady. Not many people have noticed that Brit'
 db 'annia's problem with Moongates -- they're being so unreliabl'
 db 'e -- occurred around the same time. It follows that The Guar'
 db 'dian is most likely responsible for this serious plague.'
L0EB8: db 00
L0EB9: db 'The Guardian also possesses some kind of power which allows '
 db 'him to speak to and `charm' naive innocents so that they wil'
 db 'l gladly join The Fellowship and become Grade One members. T'
 db 'hese unfortunate lambs will most likely become The Guardian''
 db 's slaves should he ever come into power.'
L0FD1: db 00

 db ' The Fellowship, I shall present this notebook to Lord Briti'
 db 'sh himself and rid Britannia of these very dangerous, lying '
