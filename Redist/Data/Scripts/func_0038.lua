--- Sets the position of an object in the world
--- Note: This is called from func_081D with a position table after adjusting coords
--- But func_081D doesn't pass the object ID, so we can't actually set position here
--- The position adjustment must happen in func_081D itself
function func_0038(position)
    -- position is a table {x, z}
    -- This function can't work without the object reference
    -- The actual position setting happens in func_081E instead
    return true
