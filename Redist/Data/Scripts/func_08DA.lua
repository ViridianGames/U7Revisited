--- Best guess: Manages a dialogue with a ghost (likely Rowena) who is unwell and requests to postpone conversation.
function func_08DA()
    start_conversation()
    local var_0000

    var_0000 = unknown_0909H()
    add_dialogue("The lovely ghost holds up her hand as you begin to speak, \"Please, " .. var_0000 .. ", forgive me, I am not feeling very well right now. Come back later and mayhaps I'll feel more disposed to conversation.\"")
    return
