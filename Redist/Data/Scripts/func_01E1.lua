--- Best guess: Initiates an object state change or interaction (linked to func_01B3), possibly for a chained mechanism or event trigger.
function func_01E1(eventid, objectref)
    if eventid == 1 or eventid == 2 then
        -- call [0000] (0942H, unmapped)
        unknown_0942H(435, objectref)
    end
    return
end
